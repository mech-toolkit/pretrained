# pretrained
Pre-trained weight files for mech recognition 


# Rest of mech-toolkit:
- [mcu](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mcu) - repo contains source code for Micro Controler Units.  (The little boards on the mech that input vision, and ultrasonics and control the servos that move the mech.)
- [mechlib](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mechlib) - a small python libary for autonomously controling mech's.  This integrates networking, vision, and motion control to control the mech.
- [pretrained](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/pretrained) - The releases of pre-trained AI models for mechs.
- [platforms](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/platforms) - The mechanical and electrical documentation for mechs.
